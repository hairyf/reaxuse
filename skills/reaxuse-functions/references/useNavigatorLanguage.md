# useNavigatorLanguage

Reactive [navigator.language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/language)

## Usage

```tsx
import { useNavigatorLanguage } from '@reaxuse/core'

const { language, isSupported } = useNavigatorLanguage()
// `language` is a `string | undefined` state — the component re-renders on
// the window `languagechange` event
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
export interface UseNavigatorLanguageOptions extends ConfigurableWindow {}
export interface UseNavigatorLanguageReturn {
  /**
   * Whether the Navigator `language` property is available in the current
   * window. `false` during SSR and before the mount effect has probed
   * `navigator`.
   */
  isSupported: boolean
  /**
   *
   * ISO 639-1 standard Language Code
   *
   * @info The detected user agent language preference as a language tag
   * (which is sometimes referred to as a "locale identifier").
   * This consists of a 2-3 letter base language tag that indicates a
   * language, optionally followed by additional subtags separated by
   * '-'. The most common extra information is the country or region
   * variant (like 'en-US' or 'fr-CA').
   *

  language: string | undefined
}
/**
 * Reactive useNavigatorLanguage
 *
 * Detects the currently selected user language and returns a reactive language
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useNavigatorLanguage`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useNavigatorLanguage/`), which reads
 * `navigator?.language` and keeps it fresh via a `languagechange` listener.
 * Reactive `navigator.language` as an object mirroring the upstream
 * `{ isSupported, language }` members — the component re-renders when the
 * user's language preference changes.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - the Vue `ShallowRef<string | undefined>` return becomes a plain
 *   `string | undefined` state, so read `language` directly instead of
 *   `watch`ing it;
 * - `isSupported` (upstream `useSupported`) becomes a plain boolean that
 *   starts `false` and is computed in the mount effect, so nothing touches
 *   `navigator` during render (SSR-safe);
 * - the initial `navigator.language` read happens in the mount effect
 *   (upstream reads it during setup);
 * - the `languagechange` listener lives in a self-contained `useEffect`
 *   (upstream uses `useEventListener`) and is removed on unmount.
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/core/useNavigatorLanguage/
 * @param options
 *
 * @example
 * const { language, isSupported } = useNavigatorLanguage()
