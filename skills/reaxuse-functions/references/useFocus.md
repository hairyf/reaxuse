# useFocus

Reactive utility to track or set the focus state of a DOM element

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { useFocus } from '@reaxuse/core'
import { useRef } from 'react'

const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
const [isFocused, setFocused] = useFocus(input)
```

State changes to reflect whether the target element is the focused element. Setting the reactive
state from the outside with `setFocused(true)` / `setFocused(false)` will trigger `focus` and `blur`
events for `true` and `false` values respectively.

## Setting initial focus

To focus the element on its first render one can provide the `initialValue` option as `true`. This
will trigger a `focus` event on the target element.

```tsx
const [isFocused] = useFocus(input, { initialValue: true })
```

## Change focus state

Changes of the `isFocused` state via `setFocused` will automatically trigger `focus` and `blur`
events for `true` and `false` values respectively. You can utilize this behavior to focus the target
element as a result of another action (e.g. when a button click as shown below).

```tsx
import { useFocus } from '@reaxuse/core'
import { useRef } from 'react'

function Component() {
  const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
  const [isFocused, setFocused] = useFocus(input)

  return (
    <div>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => setFocused(true)}>
        Click me to focus input below
      </button>
      <input ref={input} type="text" />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Return Values

Returns a readonly tuple (React array destructuring, not a Vue-style ref object):

```ts
const [isFocused, setFocused] = useFocus(input)
```

| Element      | Type                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isFocused`  | `boolean`                           | Whether the target element has focus. Updated by the target's `focus` / `blur` events.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `setFocused` | `Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>` | Focus the target with `setFocused(true)`, blur it with `setFocused(false)`. Accepts the functional updater form (`setFocused(prev => !prev)`). As upstream, the call itself only invokes `focus()` / `blur()` on the element — the state is then updated by the `focus` / `blur` events. |

## React divergence from upstream

Upstream VueUse returns `{ focused: WritableComputedRef<boolean> }`, so consumers read and write
`focused.value`. This port follows the React idiom required by `AGENTS.md` and returns the tuple
`[isFocused, setFocused]` — read the state from element 0, focus / blur the target with element 1,
and there is no `.value`.

## Type Declarations

```ts
export interface UseFocusOptions extends ConfigurableWindow {
  /**
   * Initial value. If set true, then focus will be set on the target
   *
   * @default false
   */
  initialValue?: boolean
  /**
   * Replicate the :focus-visible behavior of CSS
   *
   * @default false
   */
  focusVisible?: boolean
  /**
   * Prevent scrolling to the element when it is focused.
   *
   * @default false
   */
  preventScroll?: boolean
}
export type UseFocusReturn = readonly [
  /**
   * If read as true, then the element has focus. If read as false, then the
   * element does not have focus. This is the plain React state updated by the
   * target's `focus` / `blur` events.
   */
  isFocused: boolean,
  /**
   * If set to true, then the element will be focused. If set to false, the
   * element will be blurred. Accepts the React functional updater
   * (`setFocused(prev => !prev)`). As upstream, the assignment itself only
   * calls `focus()` / `blur()` on the element — the state is then updated by
   * the `focus` / `blur` events.
   */
  setFocused: Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>,
]
/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useFocus`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useFocus`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useFocus/`). Reactive utility to track or set
 * the focus state of a DOM element. Listens to the target's `focus` / `blur`
 * events and exposes the state as the first element of a React tuple;
 * calling `setFocused(true)` / `setFocused(false)` focuses / blurs the
 * target. As upstream, the setter itself only calls `focus()` / `blur()` on
 * the element — the state is then updated by the `focus` / `blur` events.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - upstream returns `{ focused: WritableComputedRef<boolean> }`, so consumers
 *   read and write `focused.value`; reaxuse returns the React tuple
 *   `[isFocused, setFocused]` (array destructuring, no `.value`) — read the
 *   state from element 0 and focus / blur the target with element 1
 *   (`Dispatch<SetStateAction<boolean>>`, so the functional updater
 *   `setFocused(prev => !prev)` is supported);
 * - upstream composes `useEventListener` + `computed` + `watch`; here the
 *   `focus` / `blur` listeners live in a `useEffect` that re-attaches when
 *   the resolved target changes, and upstream's immediate
 *   `watch(targetElement, …)` that applies `initialValue` becomes a mount /
 *   target-change effect. Options are read through latest-value refs, so the
 *   listeners and the setter stay stable and never re-subscribe (upstream
 *   reads the options once in setup);
 * - the target is resolved with `toValue` during render (a plain element or a
 *   ref-like `{ current }` object), so SSR renders the default
 *   `false` state without touching the DOM.
 *
 * @example
 * const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
 * const [isFocused, setFocused] = useFocus(input)
 *
 * setFocused(true) // focus the input
 * setFocused(false) // blur the input
 */
export declare function useFocus(
  target: RefOrValue<HTMLElement | SVGElement | null | undefined>,
  options?: UseFocusOptions,
): UseFocusReturn
