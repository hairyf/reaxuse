# syncState

Two-way state synchronization between two writable `State<T>` sources

## Usage

```tsx
import { syncState } from '@reaxuse/shared'
import { useState } from 'react'

function App() {
  const [a, setA] = useState('a')
  const [b, setB] = useState('b')

  const stop = syncState([a, setA], [b, setB])

  console.log(a) // a

  setB('foo') // then the component re-renders

  console.log(a) // foo

  setA('bar') // then the component re-renders

  console.log(b) // bar

  // stop()
}
```

`syncState` is a hook: call it unconditionally at the top level of a component (or another hook). Each side accepts any shared `State<T>` — a plain value, a getter, a ref-like `{ current }`, a `[value, setter]` tuple or a `{ value, onChange }` pair. Values are read with `toValue` and written back through the side's writable form (tuple setter, `onChange` callback or `.current`); a plain value or getter has no write path, so that side is treated as read-only (the sync becomes one-way for it).

### One directional

```tsx
import { syncState } from '@reaxuse/shared'

// right follows left
const stopLTR = syncState([a, setA], [b, setB], { direction: 'ltr' })

// left follows right
const stopRTL = syncState([a, setA], [b, setB], { direction: 'rtl' })
```

### Custom Transform

```tsx
import { syncState } from '@reaxuse/shared'
import { useState } from 'react'

const [a, setA] = useState(10)
const [b, setB] = useState(2)

const stop = syncState([a, setA], [b, setB], {
  transform: {
    ltr: left => left * 2,
    rtl: right => right / 2,
  },
})

console.log(a) // 10
console.log(b) // 20
```

## Options

The options mirror upstream's `SyncRefOptions`. `flush` and `deep` are accepted for signature compatibility but have no React behavior — effects always run after commit, and only `current` replacement (not nested mutation) can be observed.

```ts
export interface SyncStateOptions<L, R, D extends SyncStateDirection = 'both'> {
  /**
   * Timing for syncing, same as watch's flush option
   *
   * @default 'sync'
   */
  flush?: 'sync' | 'pre' | 'post'
  /**
   * Watch deeply
   *
   * @default false
   */
  deep?: boolean
  /**
   * Sync values immediately
   *
   * @default true
   */
  immediate?: boolean
  /**
   * Direction of syncing
   *
   * @default 'both'
   */
  direction?: D
  /**
   * Value convertors applied on the way to the other side
   */
  transform?: Partial<SyncStateTransform<L, R>>
}
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
export type SyncStateDirection = "both" | "ltr" | "rtl"
export interface SyncStateTransform<L, R> {
  ltr: (left: L) => R
  rtl: (right: R) => L
}
export interface SyncStateOptions<L, R, D extends SyncStateDirection = "both"> {
  /**
   * Timing for syncing, same as watch's `flush` option.
   *
   * React note: no React equivalent — effects always run after commit, so
   * `'sync'` / `'pre'` / `'post'` are accepted for upstream signature
   * compatibility and all behave identically.
   *
   * @default 'sync'
   */
  flush?: "sync" | "pre" | "post"
  /**
   * Watch deeply.
   *
   * React note: no React equivalent — a `.current` write never schedules a
   * re-render by itself, so nested mutations cannot be observed (only the
   * value as a whole is compared, via `Object.is`). Accepted for upstream
   * signature compatibility.
   *
   * @default false
   */
  deep?: boolean
  /**
   * Sync values immediately (on mount).
   *
   * @default true
   */
  immediate?: boolean
  /**
   * Direction of syncing.
   *
   * @default 'both'
   */
  direction?: D
  /**
   * Value convertors applied on the way to the other side: `ltr` maps a left
   * value before it is written into the right state, `rtl` maps a right
   * value before it is written into the left state. A missing convertor
   * falls back to identity.
   */
  transform?: Partial<SyncStateTransform<L, R>>
}
/**
 * Two-way state synchronization — keeps two writable `State<T>` sources in
 * sync, with optional direction and value transforms.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/shared `syncRef`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/shared/syncRef/`), renamed `syncState` for the
 * React port: the two sides are `State<T>` sources — a `[value, setter]`
 * tuple, a `{ value, onChange }` pair, a ref-like `{ current }`, a getter or
 * a plain value — instead of Vue refs. Each side is read with `toValue` and
 * written back through its writable form (tuple setter / `onChange` /
 * `.current`); plain values and getters have no write path, so that side is
 * treated as read-only (the sync becomes one-way for it).
 *
 * React Hook adaptation: upstream drives both sides through Vue's reactive
 * `watchPausable`, pausing all watchers while writing so a side never echoes
 * its own write back. React has no reactive system, so `syncState` is
 * implemented as a hook (call it unconditionally at the top of a component).
 * A `useEffect` that runs after every commit compares each side's resolved
 * value with the last observed one via `Object.is` and mirrors the changed
 * side into the other — through the optional `transform` convertors when
 * given — recording the value it just wrote as already observed on the
 * receiving side (the React analogue of upstream's pause/resume). Ref-like
 * `.current` writes are synchronous and need no absorption; writes through a
 * setter / `onChange` are asynchronous, so until the target's value reflects
 * the write the stale pre-write value is absorbed and never mistaken for an
 * external change. Read-only sides (plain values / getters) are never marked
 * as written, so a changing source keeps propagating. The initial sync
 * (upstream default `immediate: true`) runs in the mount effect and cascades
 * ltr before rtl,
 * matching upstream's watcher creation order. Because the observation happens
 * post-commit, an external mutation is only adopted on the render that
 * follows it — the mutation itself never schedules a render, so a bare
 * `.current` write outside of React is not observed (see the maintainer
 * notes on reaxuse #40 / #41). The returned `stop` function tears the
 * synchronization down; the effect also stops doing any work once the owning
 * component unmounts.
 *
 * @example
 * const [a, setA] = useState('a')
 * const [b, setB] = useState('b')
 *
 * const stop = syncState([a, setA], [b, setB])
 *
 * console.log(a) // a
 *
 * setB('foo') // then the component re-renders
 * console.log(a) // foo
 *
 * setA('bar') // then the component re-renders
 * console.log(b) // bar
 *
 * stop()
