# useResizeObserver

Reports changes to the dimensions of an Element's content or the border-box

## Usage

```tsx
import { useResizeObserver } from '@reaxuse/core'
import { useRef, useState } from 'react'

const el = useRef<HTMLTextAreaElement | null>(null)
const [text, setText] = useState('')

useResizeObserver(el, (entries) => {
  const { width, height } = entries[0].contentRect
  setText(`width: ${width}, height: ${height}`)
})
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
/**
 * Element types accepted as observation targets. Upstream's `TargetElement`
 * also includes Vue component instances (`VueInstance`) — React refs hold
 * DOM nodes directly, so there is no equivalent here.
 */
export type TargetElement = HTMLElement | SVGElement | undefined | null
/**
 * A plain element or a React ref object — the React-native replacement for
 * upstream's `ElementTarget` (in Vue semantics a `{ current }` union). React
 * refs hold DOM nodes directly, so only a `RefObject` is accepted; React's
 * `Ref<T>` also unions the callback form (`RefCallback<T>`), which cannot be
 * read synchronously and would be *invoked* by `toValue` instead of resolved,
 * so it is deliberately excluded here.
 */
export type ElementTarget<T extends TargetElement = TargetElement> =
  T | RefObject<T | null>
/**
 * A single target or an array of targets — mirrors upstream's
 * `ElementTargetOrArray`.
 */
export type ElementTargetOrArray<T extends TargetElement = TargetElement> =
  ElementTarget<T> | ElementTarget<T>[]
/**
 * Options for `useResizeObserver`: passthrough of the platform
 * `ResizeObserverOptions` (e.g. `box`) plus a custom `window` instance, e.g.
 * working with iframes or in testing environments.
 */
export interface UseResizeObserverOptions
  extends ResizeObserverOptions, ConfigurableWindow {}
/**
 * Return of `useResizeObserver`. Upstream extends `Supportable` with a
 * `ComputedRef<boolean>`; the React port exposes a plain `boolean` state.
 */
export interface UseResizeObserverReturn {
  /**
   * Whether the current environment supports the `ResizeObserver` API.
   * Starts `false` and settles in a mount effect (SSR-safe).
   */
  isSupported: boolean
  /**
   * Disconnect the observer and stop tracking target changes. Calling it
   * again is a no-op — the hook does not restart after `stop()`.
   */
  stop: () => void
}
/**
 * Reports changes to the dimensions of an Element's content or the border-box
 *
 * React port of VueUse's `useResizeObserver`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useResizeObserver`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useResizeObserver/`), which wraps a platform
 * `ResizeObserver`, observes every resolved target, and tracks target
 * changes with `watch(computed(() => ...), ..., { immediate: true, flush:
 * 'post' })`.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - the Vue `watch` over the targets computed becomes an effect that
 *   re-resolves the targets after every render and re-observes only when the
 *   resolved element set or the resolved `window` actually changed — a
 *   re-render that swaps `target.current` re-observes (mirroring the
 *   upstream reactivity) while unchanged renders never do, because every
 *   `observe()` re-delivers the current sizes;
 * - `callback` is read through a ref, so changing it does not re-observe
 *   and the returned `stop` stays referentially stable;
 * - `isSupported` is plain `boolean` state settled in the mount effect
 *   (upstream composes `useSupported`, a `ComputedRef<boolean>`);
 * - `tryOnScopeDispose(stop)` becomes an unmount effect that disconnects;
 * - the observer is constructed through the resolved `window`, and a changed
 *   `window` option re-observes (upstream destructures it once at setup;
 *   this matches this repo's `useOnline`).
 *
 * SSR-safe: nothing touches `window` during render — support detection and
 * observation both happen in effects.
 *
 * @example
 * const el = useRef<HTMLTextAreaElement | null>(null)
 * const [text, setText] = useState('')
 *
 * useResizeObserver(el, (entries) => {
 *   const { width, height } = entries[0].contentRect
 *   setText(`width: ${width}, height: ${height}`)
 * })
