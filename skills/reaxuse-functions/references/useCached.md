# useCached

Cache a value with a custom comparator

## Usage

```tsx
import { useCached } from '@reaxuse/core'
import { useState } from 'react'

interface Data {
  value: number
  extra: number
}

const [source, setSource] = useState<Data>({ value: 42, extra: 0 })
const cached = useCached(source, (newSourceValue, cachedValue) => newSourceValue.value === cachedValue.value)

setSource({ value: 42, extra: 1 })
console.log(cached) // { value: 42, extra: 0 } — only `value` is significant

setSource({ value: 43, extra: 1 })
console.log(cached) // { value: 43, extra: 1 } — significant change, cache follows
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
/**
 * Comparator deciding whether a new source value is significant enough to
 * replace the cached value.
 *
 * Upstream signature — `(newSourceValue, cachedValue) => boolean`. When it
 * returns `true`, the cache is kept as-is; when it returns `false`, the cache
 * is updated to the new source value.
 */
export type UseCachedComparator<T> = (
  newSourceValue: T,
  cachedValue: T,
) => boolean
/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useCached`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useCached`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useCached/`). Caches a value with a custom
 * comparator: the returned value only moves when the comparator reports that
 * the new source differs significantly from it, otherwise the previous value
 * is kept.
 *
 * Adjustment for React: upstream wraps a `Ref` with a `watch` that copies the
 * source into the cache whenever the comparator returns `false` — a plain
 * value cannot be watched, so the port derives the cache from the props at
 * render: one ref holds the cached value and another holds the previously
 * resolved source value. The comparator runs only when the resolved source
 * value actually changes (`Object.is`), mirroring the upstream `watch`
 * trigger, and the mount seeds the cache from the source without calling the
 * comparator. Because the change check is ref-based rather than render-based,
 * unrelated re-renders — including React StrictMode's double mount render —
 * do not re-run the comparator. The source is a plain value per the mapped
 * API, and also accepts a ref-like `{ current }` object (a React ref),
 * resolved through `isRefLike`. Only real ref-like sources are unwrapped: a
 * plain data object that happens to carry a `value` key (e.g.
 * `{ value: 42, extra: 0 }`) is cached as-is — `toValue` would unwrap it as a
 * Vue-style ref and return `42`.
 *
 * Upstream `options` are intentionally not ported: `deepRefs` (shallow vs deep
 * ref) has no React analog because the port always stores and returns the plain
 * value as-is, and `WatchOptions` (`flush` / `immediate` / `deep` / `once`)
 * configure the Vue `watch` that React has no equivalent for.
 *
 * @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__
 * @example
 * const [source, setSource] = useState({ value: 42, extra: 0 })
 * const cached = useCached(source, (newSourceValue, cachedValue) => newSourceValue.value === cachedValue.value)
 *
 * setSource({ value: 42, extra: 1 })
 * cached // { value: 42, extra: 0 } — only `value` is significant
 *
 * setSource({ value: 43, extra: 1 })
 * cached // { value: 43, extra: 1 } — significant change, cache follows
