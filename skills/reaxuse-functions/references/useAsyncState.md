# useAsyncState

Reactive async state. It will not block your component and triggers changes once the promise is ready.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useAsyncState } from '@reaxuse/core'

const initialState = { value: { id: null } }
const { state, isReady, isLoading, error, execute } = useAsyncState(
  fetchTodo,
  initialState,
)
```

### Return Values

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `state`            | The result of the async function                                                                                               |
| `setState`         | Set the state value directly, without re-executing the async function                                                          |
| `isReady`          | `true` when the latest execution has resolved successfully. Reset to `false` on each execution and stays `false` if it rejects |
| `isLoading`        | `true` while the promise is pending                                                                                            |
| `error`            | The error if the promise was rejected                                                                                          |
| `execute`          | Re-execute the async function with optional delay                                                                              |
| `executeImmediate` | Re-execute immediately (shorthand for `execute(0)`)                                                                            |

### Awaiting the Result

The return value is thenable, so you can await it and destructure directly:

```tsx
const { state, isReady } = await useAsyncState(fetchData, null)
// `state` is now populated, `isReady` is true
```

### Manual Execution

Set `immediate: false` to prevent automatic execution on mount.

```tsx
import { useAsyncState } from '@reaxuse/core'

const { state, execute, executeImmediate } = useAsyncState(action, '', { immediate: false })

async function action() {
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
  return 'done'
}

// trigger manually
executeImmediate()
execute(500) // delayed execution
```

### Options

```tsx
const { state } = useAsyncState(promise, initialState, {
  // Execute immediately on mount (default: true)
  immediate: true,
  // Delay before first execution in ms (default: 0)
  delay: 0,
  // Reset state to initial before each execution (default: true)
  resetOnExecute: true,
  // Accepted for API parity; no-op in React (default: true)
  shallow: true,
  // Throw errors instead of catching them (default: false)
  throwError: false,
  // Called when promise resolves
  onSuccess(data) {
    console.log('Success:', data)
  },
  // Called when promise rejects
  onError(error) {
    console.error('Error:', error)
  },
})
```

::: tip `shallow` is a no-op
VueUse uses `shallow` to choose between `shallowRef` and `ref` for `state` (default `true`). React
state is never deep-wrapped, so the option — and the `Shallow` generic that mirrors it — is accepted
for API parity only and has no effect: `state` is always the plain resolved value.

/**
 * Reactive async state. Will not block your component and will trigger
 * changes once the promise is ready.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useAsyncState`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useAsyncState/`). Mirrors the upstream object
 * return: `{ state, setState, isReady, isLoading, error, execute, executeImmediate }`.
 * `state` holds the resolved result of the async function, `setState` writes
 * it directly (the React equivalent of upstream's writable `state` ref, see
 * below), `isReady` becomes `true` when the latest execution resolved (reset
 * to `false` on each execution and stays `false` when it rejects), `isLoading`
 * is `true` while a promise is pending and `error` holds the rejection reason.
 * `execute(delay?, ...args)` re-runs the promise (waiting for `delay` ms first)
 * and `executeImmediate(...args)` is shorthand for `execute(0, ...args)`.
 * `onSuccess`/`onError` callbacks fire for every settled execution and
 * `throwError` re-throws the rejection from `execute`.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - upstream exposes refs (`state.value`, `isLoading.value`, ...); this port
 *   is an object mirror whose members are live React state values — the
 *   members render as plain values (no `.value`) and re-reading them yields
 *   the latest committed state (getters over the current render state);
 * - upstream's `state` ref is writable, so this port pairs it with
 *   `setState(next)` / `setState(prev => next)` (the React equivalent of
 *   `state.value = next`). `setState` updates `state` only and never triggers
 *   an execution; `isReady`, `isLoading` and `error` are left untouched;
 * - `initialState` is a read-only plain value (upstream `MaybeRef<Data>`):
 *   it is read once when the hook is created and again by each
 *   `resetOnExecute` reset, and is never written back to;
 * - the initial execution fires from a mount effect (upstream fires during
 *   setup), honoring `delay`; subsequent executions run from
 *   `execute`/`executeImmediate` with an execution counter guarding against
 *   outdated executions mutating the state. `resetOnExecute` resets `state`
 *   to the initial value at the start of each execution;
 * - the thenable contract is preserved: the returned object carries a `then`
 *   that resolves with the current result object once the latest execution
 *   finished, so `const { state } = await useAsyncState(...)` works;
 * - `shallow` is accepted for API parity but has no React equivalent — React
 *   state is never deep-wrapped, so the option is a no-op; the `Shallow`
 *   generic is likewise kept for type-arity parity only.
 *
 * @example
 * const { state, setState, isReady, isLoading, error, execute } = useAsyncState(
 *   fetchData,
 *   initialData,
 * )
 * // pass `immediate: false` and call `execute()` manually instead
 * setState(nextData) // write `state` without re-executing
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/core/useAsyncState/
