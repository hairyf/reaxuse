# useWatchDebounced

Debounced watch. The callback will only be invoked after the source stops changing for the specified duration

## Usage

Similar to `useWatch`, but offering extra options `debounce` and `maxWait` which will
be applied to the callback function.

```tsx
import { useWatchDebounced } from '@reause/shared'

useWatchDebounced(
  input,
  () => { console.log('changed!') },
  { debounce: 500, maxWait: 1000 },
)
```

### Options

| Option      | Type                 | Default | Description                                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `debounce`  | `RefOrValue<number>` | `0`     | Debounce delay in ms (can be reactive)                                   |
| `maxWait`   | `RefOrValue<number>` | —       | Maximum wait time before forced invocation                               |
| `immediate` | `boolean`            | `false` | Fire the callback once on mount with the current value (still debounced) |

Fire the callback once on mount with the current value (still debounced):

```tsx
import { useWatchDebounced } from '@reause/shared'

useWatchDebounced(input, () => console.log('changed!'), { immediate: true })
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
export interface UseWatchDebouncedOptions extends DebounceFilterOptions {
  /**
   * Debounce delay in milliseconds. Accepts a plain number or a ref-like
   * `{ current }` — re-read on every source change.
   *
   * @default 0
   */
  debounce?: RefOrValue<number>
  /**
   * Fire the callback once on mount with the current value (still debounced).
   *
   * @default false
   */
  immediate?: boolean
}
/**
 * Debounced watch — the callback fires only after the source stops changing
 * for the specified duration — React port of VueUse's `watchDebounced`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/shared `watchDebounced`
 * Mapping: upstream is a shorthand for
 * `watchWithFilter(source, cb, { eventFilter: debounceFilter(debounce, { maxWait }) })`.
 * This port composes the same pieces from house primitives: `useWatch` tracks
 * the source across renders (Vue's reactive dependency tracking becomes the
 * effect dependency list) and hands every change to `useDebounceFn`, which
 * implements the upstream `debounceFilter` (trailing edge + `maxWait`). Bursts
 * of changes collapse into a single call carrying the latest `(value, oldValue)`
 * pair captured at the last change.
 *
 * Divergences from upstream:
 * - Returns `void` — upstream returns a `WatchHandle`; here disposal follows the
 *   component lifecycle and pending timers are cancelled on unmount (via
 *   `useDebounceFn`).
 * - The source is a plain value (or array of values) tracked across renders —
 *   deep-reactive object sources and `deep` / `flush` watch options don't apply.
 * - `rejectOnCancel` (inherited from `DebounceFilterOptions`) is forwarded to
 *   `useDebounceFn` but has no observable effect — watch callbacks return
 *   nothing, so there is no promise to reject.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * useWatchDebounced(input, (value, oldValue) => console.log(value, oldValue), { debounce: 500, maxWait: 1000 })
 * useWatchDebounced([count, name], (value, oldValue) => console.log(value, oldValue), { debounce: 200 })
 * ```
