# useDrauu

Reactive instance for [drauu](https://github.com/antfu/drauu).

## Install

```bash
npm i drauu@^1
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useDrauu } from '@reause/integrations'
import { useRef } from 'react'

const target = useRef<SVGSVGElement>(null)
const { undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo, clear, brush, setBrush } = useDrauu(target, {
  brush: { color: 'black', size: 3 },
})

// `brush` is the current brush value; `setBrush` is its paired setter and
// updates both the returned value and the mounted instance
setBrush(prev => ({ ...prev, color: '#ef4444' }))

return <svg ref={target} />
```

/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useDrauu` — reactive instance for
 * [drauu](https://github.com/antfu/drauu).
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/integrations `useDrauu`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/integrations/useDrauu/`), which creates a drauu
 * instance for an `<svg>` element and exposes the drawing API plus its events.
 * Upstream has no test file — the co-located `useDrauu.test.tsx` is authored
 * for this port.
 *
 * Adjustment for React (upstream returns `Ref` / `ShallowRef` / `EventHookOn`):
 * - the return is an OBJECT with a paired setter for every caller-writable
 *   value (return-shape rule 5). `brush` is the only such value — upstream's
 *   writable `Ref<Brush>` — and it is paired with `setBrush`, the React state
 *   setter (`Dispatch<SetStateAction<Brush>>`), so `setBrush(next)` and
 *   `setBrush(prev => next)` both work; `setBrush` writes the state AND the
 *   mounted instance's brush / mode, mirroring upstream's deep watcher;
 * - `drauuInstance`, `canUndo` and `canRedo` are plain values from state
 *   instead of refs and stay read-only outputs without paired setters: the
 *   hook owns the instance lifecycle and re-reads the undo / redo status from
 *   the instance on every drauu `changed` event, so a caller write would be
 *   overwritten (upstream returns them as writable `Ref` / `ShallowRef`s;
 *   precedent: `useFileSystemAccess`'s `file`, `useAsyncState`'s `isReady` /
 *   `error`, `useTextareaAutosize`'s `textarea`);
 * - the five `on*` members are §2D registrars — `(fn) => ({ off })` typed
 *   `ListenerOn<T>` (`@reause/shared`), consumable as
 *   `useListener(onChanged, cb)` for automatic cleanup on unmount, and `off()`
 *   removes exactly that listener and is idempotent;
 * - the instance is created in an effect keyed on the resolved element's
 *   identity (upstream: `watch(() => unrefElement(target), ..., { flush: 'post' })`)
 *   and unmounted on cleanup (`tryOnScopeDispose`); an element-identity change
 *   destroys and recreates the instance. **Divergence:** resolving to `null` —
 *   a React ref whose element left the tree — destroys the instance and frees
 *   drauu's window listeners, where upstream keeps the last instance alive
 *   until scope dispose. Destroying is deliberate in React: a `null` ref means
 *   the element is gone, and a stale live instance would keep drawing on a
 *   detached `<svg>`; the co-located test pins this behavior;
 * - the element is resolved locally from `@reause/shared`'s `toValue` /
 *   `isRefLike` (precedent: `useFocusTrap.ts`), never from `@reause/core` —
 *   `packages/integrations` must not depend on core (eslint
 *   `no-restricted-imports`). Only an `SVGSVGElement` target mounts, matching
 *   upstream's guard.
 *
 * @param target - the target `<svg>` element or a React ref-like object (`{ current }`)
 * @param options - drauu options (`Omit<Options, 'el'>`); `brush` is merged over the defaults
 *
 * @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__
 * @example
 * const target = useRef<SVGSVGElement>(null)
 * const { undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo, brush, setBrush } = useDrauu(target)
 * setBrush(prev => ({ ...prev, color: '#ef4444' }))
 * return <svg ref={target} />
