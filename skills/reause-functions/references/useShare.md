# useShare

Reactive [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share)

> The `share` method has to be called following a user gesture like a button click. It can't simply be called on page load for example. That's in place to help prevent abuse.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useShare } from '@reause/core'

const { share, isSupported } = useShare()

function startShare() {
  share({
    title: 'Hello',
    text: 'Hello my friend!',
    url: location.href,
  })
}
```

## Type Declarations

```ts
export interface UseShareOptions {
  title?: string
  files?: File[]
  text?: string
  url?: string
}
export interface UseShareReturn {
  /**
   * `true` when the resolved navigator exposes `canShare` — upstream's exact
   * support check. Resolved in a mount effect, so it stays `false` during the
   * first render and on the server (SSR-safe).
   */
  isSupported: boolean
  /**
   * Triggers the Web Share API with the hook options merged under the
   * call-time overrides (overrides win). Resolves `undefined` when
   * unsupported or when `canShare` rejects the data; the promise from
   * `navigator.share` is passed through untouched — a user-cancelled share
   * (AbortError) rejects to the caller, like upstream.
   *
   * Must be called from a user gesture (e.g. a button click).
   */
  share: (overrideOptions?: UseShareOptions) => Promise<void>
}
/**
 * Specify a custom `navigator` instance, e.g. working with iframes or in
 * testing environments. Declared inline instead of re-exporting upstream's
 * configurable-navigator interface to keep the barrel export collision-free.
 */
interface UseShareNavigatorOptions {
  navigator?: Navigator
}
/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useShare`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useShare`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useShare/`). Reactive
 * [Web Share API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share).
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - upstream derives `isSupported` through its `useSupported` helper (a
 *   computed re-evaluated on mount); here it is a plain boolean state
 *   resolved in a mount effect — `false` during render and on the server
 *   (SSR-safe), `true` afterwards when the navigator exposes `canShare`
 *   (upstream's exact check — note: `canShare`, not `navigator.share`);
 * - upstream accepts `RefOrValue<UseShareOptions>`; React has no
 *   reactive refs, so options are plain values. The latest options and
 *   navigator live in refs synced each render, keeping `share` a stable
 *   callback that always reads the newest values — inline option objects
 *   and later changes are picked up without invalidating it;
 * - upstream's `ConfigurableNavigator` option is declared inline
 *   (`UseShareNavigatorOptions`, not exported) to avoid same-name barrel
 *   collisions;
 * - the `share` promise is not wrapped or caught: rejections (including the
 *   user-cancel AbortError) propagate to the caller, matching upstream.
 *
 * @example
 * const { share, isSupported } = useShare()
 *
 * function startShare() {
 *   share({ title: 'Hello', text: 'Hello my friend!', url: location.href })
 * }
