# useIDBKeyval

Wrapper for [`idb-keyval`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb-keyval).

## Install idb-keyval as a peer dependency

```bash
npm i idb-keyval@^6
```

## Usage

```tsx
import { useIDBKeyval } from '@reause/integrations'

// bind object
const [storedObject, setStoredObject, { isFinished }] = useIDBKeyval('my-idb-keyval-store', {
  hello: 'hi',
  greeting: 'Hello',
})

// update object — explicit write (no deep watcher)
setStoredObject({ ...storedObject, hello: 'hola' })

// bind boolean
const [flag] = useIDBKeyval('my-flag', true)

// bind number
const [count, setCount] = useIDBKeyval('my-count', 0)

// awaiting the IDB transaction
await setCount(10)
console.log('IDB transaction finished!')

// delete data from the idb store
await setStoredObject(null)
```

## Cross-tab syncing

Changes are automatically synced across browser tabs using the [`BroadcastChannel` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel). This is enabled by default and can be disabled via the `listenToStorageChanges` option.

```tsx
// disable cross-tab syncing
const [data] = useIDBKeyval('my-key', 'default', { listenToStorageChanges: false })
```

## Type Declarations

 * stored in IndexedDB. Defaults to an identity pair.

/**
 * Reactive [IndexedDB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
 * store — React port of VueUse's `useIDBKeyval`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/integrations `useIDBKeyval`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/integrations/useIDBKeyval/`), a reactive wrapper
 * around [`idb-keyval`](https://github.com/jakearchibald/idb-keyval). The value
 * is persisted under `key`, read once on mount and kept in sync across tabs
 * through a `BroadcastChannel`.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - the upstream object return `{ data, isFinished, isSupported, set }` becomes
 *   the state-like tuple `[data, setData, controls]` (§2B), mirroring
 *   `useStorage`: `data` is `T | null` (`null` = removed) and `setData(null)`
 *   deletes the key through `del`;
 * - **there is no deep watcher.** Upstream writes on *any* mutation of
 *   `data.value` (`watchPausable(data, write, { deep: true })`), so
 *   `data.value.count++` persists by itself. React state has no deep
 *   observation, so writes happen **explicitly through `setData`** — that is
 *   the React contract. Mutating an object held in `data` in place does *not*
 *   persist; call `setData(next)` with a new value instead. The `deep` /
 *   `shallow` / `flush` options are accepted for parity and have no effect;
 * - `isFinished` / `isSupported` live in the third tuple slot as plain
 *   booleans (upstream: `ShallowRef` / `ComputedRef`), and `isSupported` is
 *   computed synchronously (`typeof window !== 'undefined' && 'BroadcastChannel'
 *   in window`) instead of going through `useSupported`, so a `BroadcastChannel`
 *   is available on the first mount effect;
 * - `initialValue` is the hook's **read-only value source** and takes a plain
 *   `T` (upstream: `MaybeRefOrGetter<T>`); it is resolved once at mount, as
 *   upstream's `toValue(initialValue)` is — the hook owns writes, so later
 *   prop changes are ignored;
 * - a `delete` message from another tab resets `data` to the initial value
 *   (upstream parity) but does not re-write the store: incoming syncs never
 *   write back, mirroring upstream's paused watcher;
 * - the async read and the channel listener never set state after unmount.
 *
 * @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__
 * @example
 * const [data, setData, { isFinished, isSupported }] = useIDBKeyval('my-store', { count: 0 })
 *
 * // explicit write (no deep watcher)
 * setData({ count: 1 })
 *
 * // remove the key
 * await setData(null)
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/integrations/useIDBKeyval/
