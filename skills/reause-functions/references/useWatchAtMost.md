# useWatchAtMost

Like `useWatch`, but the callback fires at most `count` times

## Usage

Similar to `useWatch` with an extra option `count` which sets the number of
times the callback is triggered. After the count is reached, further changes
are ignored.

```tsx
import { useWatchAtMost } from '@reause/shared'
import { useState } from 'react'

const [num, setNum] = useState(0)

const { count, stop, pause, resume } = useWatchAtMost(
  num,
  () => { console.log('trigger!') }, // triggered at most 3 times
  {
    count: 3, // the number of times triggered
  },
)
```

- `count` — the number of times the callback has fired so far (React state, so reads re-render).
- `stop()` — stop watching before the limit is reached.
- `pause()` / `resume()` — suspend and restore firing; changes made while paused neither fire the callback nor count towards the limit.
- `immediate: true` — fire the callback once on mount with the current value; the mount call counts towards the limit.
- Upstream's other `WatchWithFilterOptions` members (`deep`, `flush`, `onTrack`, `onTrigger`) are not accepted — they are not expressible in React (no reactive graph, no configurable commit), and passing them fails type checking.

## Type Declarations

```ts
export interface UseWatchAtMostOptions {
  /**
   * The maximum number of times the callback may fire.
   */
  count: number
  /**
   * Fire the callback once on mount with the current value.
   * @default false
   */
  immediate?: boolean
}
export interface UseWatchAtMostReturn {
  /**
   * The number of times the callback has fired so far.
   */
  count: number
  /**
   * Stop watching before the limit is reached.
   */
  stop: () => void
  /**
   * Pause the watch — source changes do not fire the callback nor count
   * towards the limit until `resume` is called.
   */
  pause: () => void
  /**
   * Resume a paused watch.
   */
  resume: () => void
}
export declare function useWatchAtMost<T extends any[]>(
  source: readonly [...T],
  callback: UseWatchCallback<[...T]>,
  options: UseWatchAtMostOptions,
): UseWatchAtMostReturn
export declare function useWatchAtMost<T>(
  source: T,
  callback: UseWatchCallback<T>,
  options: UseWatchAtMostOptions,
): UseWatchAtMostReturn
```
