/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useWebWorker`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useWebWorker`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useWebWorker/`), which wraps `new Worker`
 * and exposes the instance, a `post` shortcut, `terminate`, and the latest
 * message data. The dependency-injected worker factory upstream function
 * (`useWebWorkerFn`) is a separate mapping and not part of this port.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - the Vue `ShallowRef` returns become plain state: `data` and `worker`
 *   are `useState` values, updated when a message arrives or the worker is
 *   mounted;
 * - the worker is created in a mount `useEffect` instead of during setup
 *   (upstream creates it synchronously behind an `if (window)` check), so
 *   SSR renders the initial `null`/`undefined` values without ever touching
 *   `Worker` — SSR-safe;
 * - `post` and `terminate` are stable callbacks reading the mounted worker
 *   through a latest-value ref (upstream: closures over the same ref);
 * - the worker is terminated when the component unmounts (upstream:
 *   `tryOnScopeDispose`), including an adopted `Worker` instance passed as
 *   the first argument — under React StrictMode the remount cycle
 *   terminates an adopted instance, so prefer the factory-function form for
 *   those;
 * - `url` and `workerOptions` are read at mount time: changing them does
 *   not recreate the worker (upstream setup runs once), only a change of
 *   the `window` option does.
 *
 * @example
 * const { data, post, terminate, worker } = useWebWorker<string>('/path/to/worker.js')
 * post('hello') // the worker replies via self.postMessage(...)
