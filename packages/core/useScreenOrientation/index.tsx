/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useScreenOrientation`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useScreenOrientation`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useScreenOrientation/`). Reactive Screen
 * Orientation API — the current orientation type and angle, plus
 * lock/unlock controls.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - the Vue `orientation`/`angle` shallowRefs become plain state values;
 * - `isSupported` (upstream `useSupported`) starts `false` and is computed in
 *   the mount effect, so nothing touches `screen` during render (SSR-safe);
 * - the initial `screen.orientation` read happens in the same mount effect
 *   (upstream reads it during setup);
 * - the window `orientationchange` listener (upstream `useEventListener`,
 *   passive) lives in a self-contained `useEffect` and is removed on unmount;
 * - `lockOrientation`/`unlockOrientation` use the `screen.orientation`
 *   instance captured once by that mount effect, mirroring upstream's
 *   setup-time capture (gated on `isSupported`): a later replacement or
 *   polyfill of `screen.orientation` is ignored and lock rejects
 *   `'Not supported'`, exactly as upstream does.
 *
 * @example
 * const { isSupported, orientation, angle, lockOrientation, unlockOrientation } = useScreenOrientation()
 *
 * lockOrientation('portrait-primary')
