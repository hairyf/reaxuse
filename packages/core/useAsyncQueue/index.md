# useAsyncQueue

Executes each asynchronous task sequentially and passes the current task result to the next task

## Usage

```ts
import { useAsyncQueue } from '@reause/core'

function p1() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(1000)
    }, 10)
  })
}

function p2(result: number) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve(1000 + result)
    }, 20)
  })
}

const { activeIndex, result } = useAsyncQueue([p1, p2])

console.log(activeIndex) // current pending task index (number)

console.log(result) // the tasks result
```

### Result State

Each task in the result array has a `state` and `data` property:

```ts
interface UseAsyncQueueResult<T> {
  state: 'aborted' | 'fulfilled' | 'pending' | 'rejected'
  data: T | null
}
```

### Interrupt on Failure

By default, if a task fails, subsequent tasks will not be executed. Set `interrupt: false` to continue executing even after failures.

```ts
const { result } = useAsyncQueue([p1, p2], {
  interrupt: false, // continue even if p1 fails
})
```

### Callbacks

```ts
const { result } = useAsyncQueue([p1, p2], {
  onError() {
    console.log('A task failed')
  },
  onFinished() {
    console.log('All tasks completed (or interrupted)')
  },
})
```

### Abort Signal

You can pass an `AbortSignal` to cancel the queue execution.

```ts
const controller = new AbortController()

const { result } = useAsyncQueue([p1, p2], {
  signal: controller.signal,
})

// Later, abort the queue
controller.abort()
```

### React Divergences

- `activeIndex` is a `number` and `result` is a plain array — read them directly, without `.value` (upstream returns a `ShallowRef` and a `reactive` array).
- The queue starts from a mount effect (after the first render) instead of synchronously during setup. A started ref keeps it running exactly once under React StrictMode's double-mounted effect.
- Once a task is marked `aborted`, a late resolution from an in-flight task does not overwrite the aborted entry.
