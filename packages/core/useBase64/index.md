# useBase64

Reactive base64 transforming. Supports plain text, buffer, files, canvas, objects, maps, sets and images.

## Usage

```tsx
import { useBase64 } from '@reause/core'

const [text, setText] = useState('')

const { base64, promise, execute } = useBase64(text)
```

### Supported Input Types

- `string` — Plain text
- `Blob` — File or blob data
- `ArrayBuffer` — Binary data
- `HTMLCanvasElement` — Canvas element
- `HTMLImageElement` — Image element
- `Object` / `Array` / `Map` / `Set` — Serialized to JSON

### Return Values

| Property  | Description                                                                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `base64`  | The resulting base64 string; `''` until the first transformation settles               |
| `promise` | The promise of the current transformation; `undefined` until the first `execute()` run |
| `execute` | Manually trigger the transformation; no-ops (resolving `undefined`) outside a browser  |

### Data URL Format

By default, the output is in Data URL format (e.g., `data:text/plain;base64,...`). Set `dataUrl: false` to get raw base64.

```tsx
const { base64 } = useBase64(text, { dataUrl: false })
// Returns raw base64 without the data URL prefix
```

### Canvas and Image Options

When transforming canvas or image elements, you can specify the MIME type and quality.

```tsx
const canvas = document.querySelector('canvas')

const { base64 } = useBase64(canvas, {
  type: 'image/jpeg', // MIME type
  quality: 0.8, // Image quality (0-1, for jpeg/webp)
})
```

### Custom Serializer

For objects, arrays, maps and sets, you can provide a custom serializer. Otherwise, the data will be serialized using `JSON.stringify` (maps are converted to objects, sets to arrays).

```tsx
const data = { foo: 'bar' }

const { base64 } = useBase64(data, {
  serializer: v => JSON.stringify(v, null, 2),
})
```

## React Divergences

- `base64` and `promise` are plain state values (upstream returns `shallowRef`s) read directly off the hook result. `promise` is `undefined` until the first `execute()` run, and `base64` is `''` until the first transformation settles.
- **Re-transform trigger.** Upstream watches a reactive source with `watch(target, execute, { immediate: true })` and calls `execute()` exactly once during setup for a plain value. reause resolves the source with `toValue` during render and re-runs the transformation in an effect keyed on the resolved value, so:
  - a ref-like `{ current }` source re-transforms only after a re-render that carries a new `current` — mutating `current` alone does not trigger a transformation;
  - an in-flight earlier transform can still overwrite a newer `base64` (the same race exists upstream).
- **SSR.** `execute` is a no-op that resolves `undefined` outside a browser, and the automatic first transform runs only in a mount effect, so nothing touches the DOM during render.
