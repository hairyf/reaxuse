# useFocus

Reactive utility to track or set the focus state of a DOM element

## Usage

```tsx
import { useFocus } from '@reaxuse/core'
import { useRef } from 'react'

const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
const { focused, isFocused } = useFocus(input)
```

State changes to reflect whether the target element is the focused element. Setting the reactive
`focused.value` from the outside will trigger `focus` and `blur` events for `true` and `false`
values respectively.

## Setting initial focus

To focus the element on its first render one can provide the `initialValue` option as `true`. This
will trigger a `focus` event on the target element.

```tsx
const { focused } = useFocus(input, { initialValue: true })
```

## Change focus state

Changes of the `focused` ref value will automatically trigger `focus` and `blur` events for
`true` and `false` values respectively. You can utilize this behavior to focus the target element as
a result of another action (e.g. when a button click as shown below).

```tsx
import { useFocus } from '@reaxuse/core'
import { useRef } from 'react'

function Component() {
  const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)
  const { focused } = useFocus(input)

  return (
    <div>
      <button type="button" onClick={() => (focused.value = true)}>
        Click me to focus input below
      </button>
      <input ref={input} type="text" />
    </div>
  )
}
```
