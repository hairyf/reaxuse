# useCloned

Reactive clone of a value. By default, it use `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify())` to do the clone

## Usage

```tsx
import { useCloned } from '@reaxuse/core'

const original = { key: 'value' }

const [cloned, setCloned, { isModified, sync }] = useCloned(original)

// on the next render `cloned` is the new state and `isModified` is true
setCloned({ key: 'some new value' })

console.log(cloned.key) // 'some new value' (next render)

sync() // re-clone from the source, isModified back to false
```

The return is a React tuple `[cloned, setCloned, { isModified, sync }]` — upstream returns an object
`{ cloned: Ref<T>, isModified, sync }`. `cloned` is a plain state value (not a writable ref), and
`setCloned` replaces it with the React immutable-update protocol: it never re-syncs from the source
(use `sync()` for that). Changes to the source are not reflected in the cloned controllable state
immediately.

## Source Forms

`source` is a React `State<T>` and every form is resolved through `toValue`. The snippets below show
the values on the render that follows the change:

```tsx
import { useCloned } from '@reaxuse/core'

const [cloned] = useCloned(plainValue) // plain value
const [cloned] = useCloned(() => value) // getter
const [cloned] = useCloned(ref) // React ref (`{ current }`)
const [cloned] = useCloned([value, setValue]) // state tuple
const [cloned] = useCloned({ value, onChange: setValue }) // value/onChange pair
```

Every form except a plain value is treated as reactive, so `immediate: false` skips the initial sync
for them too. This is a deliberate difference from upstream `MaybeRefOrGetter<T>`
(`T | Ref<T> | (() => T)`): the `[value, setter]` tuple and `{ value, onChange }` pair are the React
state protocol and have no upstream equivalent.

## Return Values

- `cloned` — the current clone (plain state).
- `setCloned(next | prev => next)` — replaces the clone. This is the React-idiomatic way to edit it: it
  does not re-sync from the source, and it updates `isModified` by comparing the new value with the
  last synced source.
- `controls.isModified` — `true` while the clone differs from the last synced source.
- `controls.sync()` — re-clone from the source and reset `isModified` to `false`.

The `controls` object (`{ isModified, sync }`) keeps a stable identity while `isModified` and `sync`
are unchanged.

Mutating `cloned` in place is still detected on the next render as a legacy fallback, but prefer
`setCloned` — mutating state in place is not idiomatic React.

## Watch Options

`deep` and `immediate` control how the clone follows the source. Both default to `true`:
`immediate: true` syncs the clone on mount, and `deep: true` re-syncs on in-place mutations of the
source (set `deep: false` to only re-sync when the source reference is replaced).

```tsx
import { useCloned } from '@reaxuse/core'

const original = { current: { key: 'value' } }

// no initial sync, and in-place mutations are ignored
const [cloned] = useCloned(original, { immediate: false, deep: false })

console.log(cloned) // {}

original.current.key = 'ignored' // deep: false — no re-sync

original.current = { key: 'replaced' } // new reference — re-syncs on the next render

console.log(cloned) // { key: 'replaced' }
```

## Manual cloning

```tsx
import { useCloned } from '@reaxuse/core'

const original = { current: { key: 'value' } }

const [cloned, , { sync }] = useCloned(original, { manual: true })

original.current.key = 'manual'

console.log(cloned.key) // 'value'

sync()

console.log(cloned.key) // 'manual'
```

## Custom Clone Function

Using [`klona`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/klona) for example:

```tsx
import { useCloned } from '@reaxuse/core'
import { klona } from 'klona'

const original = { key: 'value' }

const [cloned, , { isModified, sync }] = useCloned(original, { clone: klona })
```
