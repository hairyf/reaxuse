/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useTimeoutPoll`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useTimeoutPoll`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useTimeoutPoll/`): a timeout-based poll chain
 * that triggers the callback one `interval` after activation and re-schedules
 * only after the previous run has finished, so a slow poll never overlaps
 * itself. Self-contained `setTimeout` chain (upstream composes
 * `useTimeoutFn`); there is no document-visibility gating in upstream, so
 * none here either.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - `fn` and `interval` are plain values kept in refs (upstream: closure +
 *   `RefOrValue<number>`), so `pause` / `resume` stay referentially
 *   stable and a changing (typically stable) callback identity never restarts
 *   the chain. Like upstream, the `interval` is only read when a run is
 *   scheduled — a changed `interval` does not re-arm the pending timeout,
 *   which keeps its old cadence until the next schedule;
 * - the `isActive` shallow ref becomes a plain boolean state, flipped by
 *   `resume` / `pause` (upstream sets it synchronously during setup);
 * - the setup-time auto `resume()` (`immediate`, client-only) becomes a mount
 *   `useEffect`, and `tryOnScopeDispose(pause)` becomes its cleanup — timers
 *   only ever run inside effects, so SSR renders never touch them;
 * - upstream does not fire the callback synchronously on `resume`: the first
 *   run is scheduled one `interval` after activation. Pass
 *   `immediateCallback: true` to also fire it immediately on (re)activation.
 *
 * @example
 * const { isActive, pause, resume } = useTimeoutPoll(fetchData, 1000)
