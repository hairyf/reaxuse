/**
 * Reactive Battery Status API.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useBattery`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useBattery/`). Reactive
 * [Battery Status API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API):
 * returns an object mirroring the upstream members — `isSupported`,
 * `charging`, `chargingTime`, `dischargingTime`, `level` — as plain values
 * held in `useState`s.
 *
 * Adjustment for React:
 * - the upstream Vue shallow refs become plain state values read off the
 *   result object, so no `.value` is involved;
 * - `isSupported` comes from `useSupported` (resolves after mount, stays
 *   `false` on the server) and gates a mount effect that acquires the
 *   battery manager, reads its initial state and registers the four battery
 *   event listeners (`chargingchange`, `chargingtimechange`,
 *   `dischargingtimechange`, `levelchange`), removed again in cleanup on
 *   unmount (upstream: `if (isSupported.value)` setup block +
 *   `useEventListener` + `tryOnScopeDispose`);
 * - there is no `navigator` access during render, so SSR renders the
 *   defaults without acquiring anything.
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/core/useBattery/
 * @param options
 *
 * @example
 * const { isSupported, charging, chargingTime, dischargingTime, level } = useBattery()
