/**
 * React port of VueUse's `useLocalStorage`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `useLocalStorage`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/useLocalStorage/`), which is a thin wrapper
 * over `useStorage` bound to `window.localStorage`. Reactive
 * [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) —
 * the value is persisted under `key`, re-read on mount and key change, and
 * kept in sync across tabs and across hook instances sharing the same key.
 *
 * This hook has **no logic of its own** — it is a thin wrapper delegating to
 * `useStorage` (already ported) with `window.localStorage` as the backend:
 * `useStorage(key, initialValue, window.localStorage, options)`. All
 * serialization (type-guessed `StorageSerializers` or a custom `serializer`),
 * `writeDefaults` / `mergeDefaults`, same-document sync through synthetic
 * `storage` events and `onError` handling live in `useStorage`, mirroring
 * upstream where `useLocalStorage` calls `useStorage(key, initialValue,
 * window?.localStorage, options)`.
 *
 * React divergences (inherited from `useStorage`):
 * - the Vue `RemovableRef<T>` return becomes a `useState`-backed tuple
 *   `[value, setValue]`; the setter also accepts a function updater.
 *   `setValue(null)` removes the entry from storage and the state falls back
 *   to the initial value (mirroring upstream, where the self storage-event
 *   echo restores `rawInit`);
 * - storage is never touched during render: the first read happens in the
 *   mount effect, so SSR renders the initial value and the stored value
 *   replaces it after hydration;
 * - `key` is a plain React string that can change between renders — a key
 *   change re-reads the new key (upstream takes a reactive
 *   `MaybeRefOrGetter` key). Writes always go to the key of the current
 *   render, and when `writeDefaults` is on, a new key with no stored value is
 *   seeded with the initial value;
 * - Vue reactivity options have no React equivalent and are omitted:
 *   `flush`/`deep`/`eventFilter` (writes happen synchronously inside
 *   `setValue`), `shallow` (React state is replaced wholesale) and
 *   `initOnMounted` (effectively always on — the first read happens in the
 *   mount effect).
 *
 * @example
 * const [state, setState] = useLocalStorage('my-store', { hello: 'hi', greeting: 'Hello' })
 * const [flag, setFlag] = useLocalStorage('my-flag', true)
 *
 * setState(null) // delete data from storage
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/core/useLocalStorage/
