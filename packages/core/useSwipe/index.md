# useSwipe

Reactive swipe detection based on [`TouchEvents`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent)

## Usage

```tsx
import { useSwipe } from '@reause/core'
import { useRef } from 'react'

function Demo() {
  const el = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null)
  const { isSwiping, direction } = useSwipe(el)

  return (
    <div ref={el}>
      Swipe here
    </div>
  )
}
```

`target` accepts the element itself or a ref-like `{ current }` object — bind it to the element you
want to listen on (a `useRef` that is not attached to any node listens to nothing). The resolved
element is re-read after every commit, so a ref that is still `null` while rendering binds as soon
as React attaches the element.

## Options

- `passive` (`boolean`, default `true`): register the touch listeners as passive. When `false`, the
  listeners are registered with `capture: true` and a horizontal `touchmove` calls `preventDefault()`.
- `threshold` (`number`, default `50`): minimum `max(|dx|, |dy|)` in pixels before a touch counts as
  a swipe.
- `onSwipeStart` (`(e: TouchEvent) => void`): called on `touchstart` with a single touch point.
- `onSwipe` (`(e: TouchEvent) => void`): called on `touchmove` while a swipe is in progress.
- `onSwipeEnd` (`(e: TouchEvent, direction: UseSwipeDirection) => void`): called on `touchend` /
  `touchcancel` once the threshold was crossed, with the final direction.

## Return Values

- `isSwiping` (`boolean`): whether a swipe is currently in progress.
- `direction` (`'up' | 'down' | 'left' | 'right' | 'none'`): swipe direction derived from the start
  and end coordinates; `'none'` below the threshold.
- `coordsStart` / `coordsEnd` (`{ x: number, y: number }`): start and last touch coordinates.
- `lengthX` / `lengthY` (`number`): `coordsStart.x - coordsEnd.x` / `coordsStart.y - coordsEnd.y`.
- `stop` (`() => void`): permanently detach the listeners for this hook instance.

## React divergences

The Vue return object (`isSwiping` ref, `direction` / `lengthX` / `lengthY` computeds, reactive
coords) becomes plain values backed by state. React refs are not reactive like Vue's, so a
`ref.current` write that triggers no re-render cannot be observed — re-render (for example through
state) after mutating the ref to re-bind the listeners.
