/**
 * Create an asynchronous computed dependency — React port of VueUse's
 * `computedAsync`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/core `computedAsync`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/core/computedAsync/`): re-evaluates an async
 * function when its inputs change, exposes the in-flight state, supports
 * cancellation through the `onCancel` callback handed to
 * `evaluationCallback`, and protects against stale out-of-order resolutions
 * — only the latest evaluation may update the state.
 *
 * React adaptation:
 *
 * - returns the plain resolved value `T` (repo convention §2B — pure-derived
 *   value, not a ref/tuple), starting at `initialState` and managed through
 *   shared `useControllableState`; controlled state receives async results via
 *   its tuple setter or `{ value, onChange }` callback;
 * - upstream tracks reactive dependencies automatically; React has no
 *   reactive graph, so re-evaluation is driven by the explicit
 *   `options.deps` array, compared with `useEffect` semantics (default `[]`
 *   = evaluate once on mount);
 * - `initialState` is optional; omitting it yields `T | undefined` (upstream
 *   overload parity);
 * - upstream's `evaluating` ref becomes the `onEvaluating(value)` callback:
 *   `true` when an evaluation starts, `false` when it settles — resolved,
 *   rejected, or discarded by a newer evaluation or by unmount. An
 *   evaluation reports `false` at most once (a superseded evaluation
 *   settles at invalidation time, not when its abandoned promise later
 *   resolves), and it is never called after unmount;
 * - `onCancel(cb)` registers cleanup callbacks; all registered callbacks
 *   are invoked — and the registry cleared — when the deps change
 *   mid-flight or on unmount (upstream parity). They are not invoked once
 *   the evaluation has finished (upstream's `hasFinished` flag);
 * - stale protection: a monotonically increasing evaluation id discards
 *   results of evaluations superseded by a newer one (or by an unmount),
 *   mirroring upstream's `counter` guard;
 * - on rejection the current state is kept and `options.onError` receives
 *   the error (default: `globalThis.reportError`, upstream parity). Like
 *   upstream, rejections of superseded/cancelled evaluations also reach
 *   `onError` — pass a custom `onError` if cancelled runs must stay silent;
 * - sync (non-Promise) return values from `evaluationCallback` update the
 *   state synchronously within the effect;
 * - `skipInitial: true` (alias: the deprecated `lazy`) skips the mount
 *   evaluation, so evaluation happens only when `deps` change and with the
 *   default `[]` deps it never runs. Upstream's `lazy` instead starts on the
 *   first read of the returned computed, which has no React equivalent; the
 *   deprecated `lazy` alias keeps the name but not that semantic;
 * - upstream's `flush` option (`ConfigurableFlushSync`, default `'sync'`) has
 *   no mapping: re-evaluation is driven by `deps` and runs in a React effect
 *   (post-commit), the closest analogue of upstream's sync flush;
 * - upstream's `shallow` option (React state is never deep-wrapped) and the
 *   `Ref<boolean>`-as-`evaluating` overload are not portable and are
 *   collapsed into `options` only.
 *
 * The upstream `asyncComputed` deprecated alias is intentionally not ported
 * (upstream-only; use `computedAsync`).
 *
 * @__NO_SIDE_EFFECTS__
 * @example
 * const downloads = computedAsync(
 *   async (onCancel) => {
 *     const controller = new AbortController()
 *     onCancel(() => controller.abort())
 *     const response = await fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal })
 *     return response.ok ? (await response.json() as { downloads: number }).downloads : 0
 *   },
 *   0,
 *   { deps: [packageName] },
 * )
