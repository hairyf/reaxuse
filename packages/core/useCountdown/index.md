# useCountdown

Reactive countdown timer in seconds

## Usage

```tsx
import { useCountdown } from '@reause/core'

const countdownSeconds = 5
const [remaining, setRemaining, { start, stop, pause, resume }] = useCountdown(countdownSeconds, {
  onComplete() {

  },
  onTick() {

  }
})

start() // begins counting down from 5
setRemaining(10) // jump to 10 on the next render
```

You can use a `ref` to change the initial countdown.
`start()` and `resume()` also accept a new countdown value for the next countdown.

```tsx
import { useCountdown } from '@reause/core'

const countdown = { current: 5 }
const [, , { start, reset }] = useCountdown(countdown)

// change the countdown value
countdown.current = 10

// start a new countdown with 2 seconds
start(2)

// reset the countdown to 4, but do not start it
reset(4)

// start the countdown with the current value of `countdown`
start()
```

### Options

| Option       | Type         | Default | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `interval`   | `number`     | `1000`  | Countdown interval in milliseconds (reause-only, see below) |
| `onComplete` | `() => void` | —       | Callback function called when the countdown reaches 0        |
| `onTick`     | `() => void` | —       | Callback function called on each tick of the countdown       |

### Return Values

- `remaining` — current countdown value (plain React state; upstream: a shallow ref).
- `setRemaining(next | prev => next)` — writes the countdown state directly, with no `.value` and no Vue-style ref object; the next tick decrements from the written value.
- `controls.reset(countdown?)` — reset the countdown to its initial value.
- `controls.stop()` — stop the countdown and reset its state.
- `controls.start(countdown?)` — reset the countdown and start it again.
- `controls.pause()` — pause the countdown; `remaining` stays put.
- `controls.resume()` — resume a paused countdown (no-op at 0 or while running).
- `controls.isActive` — whether the countdown interval is currently active.

## React divergences

- The return is a React tuple `[remaining, setRemaining, { reset, stop, start, pause, resume, isActive }]` instead of upstream's object: `remaining` is a `number` and `controls.isActive` a `boolean` (no `.value`), and `setRemaining` is the React state setter writing the internal state directly.
- Upstream accepts a `scheduler` option (`UseCountdownOptions extends ConfigurableScheduler`, defaulting to `useIntervalFn(cb, 1000, { immediate: false })`). There is no React equivalent, so `scheduler` is not ported; the reause-only `interval` option sets the tick rate instead (default `1000` ms, matching upstream's default scheduler).
- A plain-number `initialCountdown` is captured once at setup, like upstream's `toValue(initialCountdown)` closure — a later no-arg `start()`/`reset()` keeps using the setup value. Pass a ref-like `{ current }` to read the latest value.
- `start()`/`resume()` begin the interval from event handlers/effects only, so no timers run during SSR.
