/**
 * Use an RxJS [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) as extracted
 * from one or more hooks, and automatically unsubscribe from it when the
 * component is unmounted.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/rxjs `useExtractedObservable`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/rxjs/useExtractedObservable/`): whenever the
 * resolved source value changes, the previous subscription is unsubscribed
 * and `extractor` derives a new `Observable` from the new value, whose
 * emissions become the hook's value. Unsubscribing happens both on a source
 * change and on unmount.
 *
 * React adaptation (upstream's Vue reactivity graph is replaced):
 *
 * - `value` is a read-only value source and takes a plain
 *   `Value | null | undefined` (upstream: `T | WatchSource<T>`, i.e. a
 *   reactive object, an array of sources or a getter). Resolve a React ref or
 *   getter at the call site; a list of sources is passed as a plain array and
 *   re-extracts when a new array identity arrives. There is no reactive graph:
 *   the effect re-runs when the value's identity changes **or** when
 *   `options.deps` change (upstream re-runs whenever any tracked source
 *   mutates), so a source object mutated **in place** needs a new identity or
 *   the mutation inputs listed in `deps`.
 * - the extractor is `(value, onCleanup) => Observable<E>`: upstream also
 *   passes Vue's `oldValue` as the second argument, which has no React
 *   equivalent (React keeps no previous-value tracking) and is dropped.
 * - upstream returns a `DeepReadonly<ShallowRef<E>>`; the React port returns
 *   the value directly (a readonly ref holds no writable value, so the
 *   structure is mirrored — §2 return rules). `initialValue` narrows the
 *   returned type to `E | I` (`I` being the `initialValue` type and
 *   defaulting to `undefined`), the same trick as `useObservable`.
 * - upstream's `watch` options (`immediate` / `deep` / `flush`) are dropped:
 *   the effect always extracts on mount (`immediate: true`, upstream's
 *   default) and re-extracts on identity / `deps` changes — React has no
 *   flush scheduler to configure. Pass `initialValue` to seed the value
 *   before the first extraction settles.
 * - `initialValue` is the `useState` initial value, so it only applies to the
 *   first render — a later source change keeps the last emitted value
 *   (upstream's `obsRef` is never reset either), and a nullish source
 *   subscribes to nothing and drops the previous subscription.
 * - `onCleanup` parity: callbacks registered through the `onCleanup` argument
 *   are collected per run and invoked before the next subscription is created,
 *   before the previous subscription is unsubscribed (upstream's Vue `watch`
 *   runs the previous cleanup before the watcher body), and on unmount.
 * - `extractor`, `onError` and `onComplete` are read through latest-value refs,
 *   so inline identities never re-subscribe; only the resolved source value
 *   and `deps` do.
 * - the option values are handed to the observer directly, so an absent
 *   `onError` leaves the error slot `undefined` and RxJS reports the error as
 *   unhandled instead of swallowing it (upstream parity).
 * - SSR-safe: nothing touches `window` / `document`, and the subscription only
 *   exists inside the mount effect.
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/rxjs/useExtractedObservable/
 * @example
 * const [start, setStart] = useState(0)
 * const count = useExtractedObservable(start, start => interval(1000).pipe(
 *   startWith(start),
 *   scan((total, next) => next + total),
 * ), { initialValue: 0 })
 * // count is 0 until the first emission, then keeps accumulating
