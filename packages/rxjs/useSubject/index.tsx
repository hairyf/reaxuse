 * Bind an RxJS [`Subject`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/subject) to a controllable
 * state and propagate value changes both ways.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/rxjs `useSubject`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/rxjs/useSubject/`): the state is initialized from a
 * `BehaviorSubject`'s current value (or `undefined` for a plain `Subject`),
 * every emission is written into the state, and writing through the returned
 * setter is pushed back into the subject.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - upstream returns a `Ref<H>` / `Ref<H | undefined>` that the caller mutates
 *   directly; the React port returns a `useState`-like writable
 *   `[value, setValue]` tuple (hairyf/reause#218).
 * - `setValue` calls `subject.next(...)` — it does **not** set React state
 *   directly. Upstream keeps two writable places (`value.value` and the
 *   subject, bridged by `watch`); here the subject is the single source of
 *   truth, so a write is observable by every other subscriber of the subject
 *   and the exposed value follows the emission that comes back through the
 *   subscription. Unlike upstream's `watch` — which skips an unchanged
 *   primitive — the write is forwarded unconditionally, so `setValue(current)`
 *   still calls `subject.next(current)` and other subscribers see it
 *   (hairyf/reause#218).
 * - the setter accepts a functional update (`useState` parity, hairyf/reause#174);
 *   it is resolved against the latest value seen by the hook, so two functional
 *   updates in the same tick compose instead of both reading the same stale
 *   value.
 * - upstream's `tryOnScopeDispose` becomes the effect cleanup: the subscription
 *   is created once when the component mounts and unsubscribed on unmount.
 * - the `subject` argument is deliberately **not** an effect dependency — a new
 *   identity on a later render neither re-subscribes (Vue's `tryOnScopeDispose`
 *   also registers exactly once, during `setup`) nor re-targets `setValue`,
 *   which keeps writing into the subject the hook is subscribed to.
 * - `onError` is read when the subscription is created.
 * - SSR-safe: nothing touches `window` / `document`, and the subscription is
 *   only created in the mount effect.
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/rxjs/useSubject/
 * @example
 * const subject = new BehaviorSubject('initial')
 * const [value, setValue] = useSubject(subject)
 * // value is 'initial'; setValue('next') pushes 'next' into the subject
