/**
 * Create an [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable) from either an
 * rxjs `ObservableInput` (forwarded to RxJS's
 * [`from()`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/function/from) unchanged) or a plain
 * value that re-emits whenever it changes across renders.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/rxjs `from`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/rxjs/from/`): upstream branches on Vue's `isRef`
 * and `watch`es the ref; React has no reactive refs, so the port branches on
 * observable-/promise-likeness and pushes plain values through an internal
 * effect instead.
 *
 * Branch discriminator (runtime):
 * - a value with a `subscribe` function (Observable-like) or a `then` function
 *   (Promise-like) is passed straight to rxjs `from(value)` — upstream parity.
 * - any other plain value is wrapped in a `BehaviorSubject` seeded with the
 *   current render value: subscribing immediately receives the current value
 *   (the mapped `immediate` semantics), and the Observable re-emits whenever
 *   the value changes across renders.
 *
 * React divergences:
 * - upstream's `Ref<T>` branch becomes the plain-value re-emit branch. The
 *   subject and its `asObservable()` wrapper are held in refs, so the returned
 *   Observable keeps a stable identity across renders and downstream
 *   subscriptions are not rebuilt by re-renders.
 * - upstream's `WatchOptions` (`immediate` / `deep` / `flush`) is dropped —
 *   React has no Vue `watch`. `immediate` is covered by the seeded
 *   `BehaviorSubject` (subscribing receives the current value immediately);
 *   `deep` / `flush` are not mapped — handle extra control at the call site
 *   with rxjs operators or effect dependencies.
 * - the value source is a plain `T` only — never a getter, `State<T>` or
 *   `RefOrValue` (AGENTS.md §2).
 * - on unmount the subject is completed: subscriptions stop and no further
 *   emissions are delivered. In dev, React StrictMode remounts effects and
 *   runs that cleanup, which completes the subject; the mount effect detects
 *   the stopped subject and reseeds it, so re-emission survives the simulated
 *   unmount/remount cycle.
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/rxjs/from/
 * @example
 * const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
 * const count$ = useFrom(count)
 * // count$ emits 0 immediately; setCount(1) re-emits 1
 * @example
 * const values$ = useFrom(of(1, 2)) // ObservableInput: rxjs from() passthrough
