/**
 * Watch the values of an RxJS [`Observable`](https://rxjs.dev/guide/observable)
 * extracted from a source value — React port of VueUse's
 * `watchExtractedObservable`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/rxjs `watchExtractedObservable`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/rxjs/watchExtractedObservable/`): whenever the
 * resolved source value changes, the previous subscription is unsubscribed
 * and `extractor` derives a new `Observable`, whose emissions are forwarded
 * to `callback`. Automatically unsubscribes when the source changes and when
 * the component unmounts.
 *
 * React adaptation (upstream's Vue reactivity graph is replaced):
 *
 * - `value` is a read-only value source and takes a plain
 *   `Value | null | undefined` (upstream: `T | WatchSource<T>`; resolve a
 *   React ref or getter at the call site). There
 *   is no reactive graph: the effect re-runs when the value's
 *   identity changes **or** when `options.deps` change (upstream re-runs
 *   whenever the tracked source mutates). A source object mutated **in place**
 *   therefore does not re-trigger — pass a new identity or list the mutation
 *   inputs in `deps`. `deps` is the React substitute for Vue's reactive
 *   tracking, the same convention as `computedAsync`'s `options.deps`
 *   (`packages/core/src/computedAsync.ts`).
 * - The extractor is `(value, onCleanup) => Observable<E>`: upstream also
 *   passes Vue's `oldValue` as the second argument, which has no React
 *   equivalent (React keeps no previous-value tracking) and is dropped.
 * - Upstream returns a `WatchHandle` function; the React hook returns
 *   `{ stop }` (§2B object return — no state-like writable pair). `stop` is a
 *   stable `useCallback`, idempotent, and — like the `WatchHandle` — permanent:
 *   it tears down the current subscription, runs the pending `onCleanup`
 *   callbacks, and prevents later `deps` / source changes from subscribing
 *   again.
 * - `onCleanup` parity: callbacks registered through the `onCleanup` argument
 *   are collected per run and invoked before the next subscription is created
 *   (upstream's Vue `watch` runs the previous cleanup before the watcher body
 *   unsubscribes) and on unmount / `stop()`. They run before the subscription
 *   is unsubscribed, mirroring upstream's ordering.
 * - A `null` / `undefined` resolved value subscribes to nothing and drops any
 *   previous subscription (upstream parity).
 * - `extractor`, `callback`, `onError` and `onComplete` are read through
 *   latest-value refs, so inline identities never re-subscribe; only the
 *   resolved source value and `deps` do.
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/watchExtractedObservable/
 * @example
 * const player = useRef<AudioPlayer | null>(null)
 * const [progress, setProgress] = useState(0)
 *
 * useWatchExtractedObservable(player, p => p.progress$, (percentage) => {
 *   setProgress(percentage * 100)
 * }, { onError: err => console.error(err) })
