/**
 * Two-way state synchronization — keeps two writable `State<T>` sources in
 * sync, with optional direction and value transforms.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/shared `syncRef`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/shared/syncRef/`), renamed `syncState` for the
 * React port: the two sides are `State<T>` sources — a `[value, setter]`
 * tuple, a `{ value, onChange }` pair, a ref-like `{ current }`, a getter or
 * a plain value — instead of Vue refs. Each side is read with `toValue` and
 * written back through its writable form (tuple setter / `onChange` /
 * `.current`); plain values and getters have no write path, so that side is
 * treated as read-only (the sync becomes one-way for it).
 *
 * React Hook adaptation: upstream drives both sides through Vue's reactive
 * `watchPausable`, pausing all watchers while writing so a side never echoes
 * its own write back. React has no reactive system, so `syncState` is
 * implemented as a hook (call it unconditionally at the top of a component).
 * A `useEffect` that runs after every commit compares each side's resolved
 * value with the last observed one via `Object.is` and mirrors the changed
 * side into the other — through the optional `transform` convertors when
 * given — recording the value it just wrote as already observed on the
 * receiving side (the React analogue of upstream's pause/resume). Ref-like
 * `.current` writes are synchronous and need no absorption; writes through a
 * setter / `onChange` are asynchronous, so until the target's value reflects
 * the write the stale pre-write value is absorbed and never mistaken for an
 * external change. Read-only sides (plain values / getters) are never marked
 * as written, so a changing source keeps propagating. The initial sync
 * (upstream default `immediate: true`) runs in the mount effect and cascades
 * ltr before rtl,
 * matching upstream's watcher creation order. Because the observation happens
 * post-commit, an external mutation is only adopted on the render that
 * follows it — the mutation itself never schedules a render, so a bare
 * `.current` write outside of React is not observed (see the maintainer
 * notes on reaxuse #40 / #41). The returned `stop` function tears the
 * synchronization down; the effect also stops doing any work once the owning
 * component unmounts.
 *
 * @example
 * const [a, setA] = useState('a')
 * const [b, setB] = useState('b')
 *
 * const stop = syncState([a, setA], [b, setB])
 *
 * console.log(a) // a
 *
 * setB('foo') // then the component re-renders
 * console.log(a) // foo
 *
 * setA('bar') // then the component re-renders
 * console.log(b) // bar
 *
 * stop()
