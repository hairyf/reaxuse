/**
 * Debounced watch — the callback fires only after the source stops changing
 * for the specified duration — React port of VueUse's `watchDebounced`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/shared `watchDebounced`
 * Mapping: upstream is a shorthand for
 * `watchWithFilter(source, cb, { eventFilter: debounceFilter(debounce, { maxWait }) })`.
 * This port composes the same pieces from house primitives: `useWatch` tracks
 * the source across renders (Vue's reactive dependency tracking becomes the
 * effect dependency list) and hands every change to `useDebounceFn`, which
 * implements the upstream `debounceFilter` (trailing edge + `maxWait`). Bursts
 * of changes collapse into a single call carrying the latest `(value, oldValue)`
 * pair captured at the last change.
 *
 * Divergences from upstream:
 * - Returns `void` — upstream returns a `WatchHandle`; here disposal follows the
 *   component lifecycle and pending timers are cancelled on unmount (via
 *   `useDebounceFn`).
 * - The source is a plain value (or array of values) tracked across renders —
 *   deep-reactive object sources and `deep` / `flush` watch options don't apply.
 * - `rejectOnCancel` (inherited from `DebounceFilterOptions`) has no observable
 *   effect — watch callbacks return nothing, so there is no promise to reject.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * useWatchDebounced(input, (value, oldValue) => console.log(value, oldValue), { debounce: 500, maxWait: 1000 })
 * useWatchDebounced([count, name], (value, oldValue) => console.log(value, oldValue), { debounce: 200 })
 * ```
