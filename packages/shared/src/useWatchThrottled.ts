/**
 * Throttled watch — the callback is invoked at most once per specified
 * duration — React port of VueUse's `watchThrottled`.
 * Map from @vueuse/shared watchThrottled.
 *
 * Mapping: upstream is a shorthand for
 * `watchWithFilter(source, cb, { eventFilter: throttleFilter(throttle, trailing, leading) })`.
 * This port composes the same pieces from house primitives: `useWatch` tracks
 * the source across renders (Vue's reactive dependency tracking becomes the
 * effect dependency list) and hands every change to `useThrottleFn`, which
 * implements the upstream `throttleFilter` (leading/trailing edges with a
 * trailing invoke on window end). Changes inside the throttle window collapse
 * into a single call carrying the latest `(value, oldValue)` pair captured at
 * the last change.
 *
 * Divergences from upstream:
 * - Returns `void` — upstream returns a `WatchHandle`; here disposal follows the
 *   component lifecycle and pending timers are cancelled on unmount (via
 *   `useThrottleFn`).
 * - The source is a plain value (or array of values) tracked across renders —
 *   deep-reactive object sources and `deep` / `flush` watch options don't apply.
 * - upstream's deprecated `throttledWatch` alias is not ported.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * useWatchThrottled(input, (value, oldValue) => console.log(value, oldValue), { throttle: 500 })
 * useWatchThrottled([count, name], (value, oldValue) => console.log(value, oldValue), { throttle: 200 })
 * ```
