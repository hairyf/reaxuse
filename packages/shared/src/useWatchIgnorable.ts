/**
 * Ignorable watch — extended watch that returns `ignoreUpdates(updater)` /
 * `ignorePrevAsyncUpdates()` / `stop` to ignore particular updates to the
 * source — React port of VueUse's `watchIgnorable`.
 * Map from @vueuse/shared watchIgnorable.
 *
 * The API follows the maintainer-directed adjustment of issue #263: the
 * source is the caller's own state value (house `useWatch` source convention)
 * and the return is the upstream `WatchIgnorableReturn` object shape — this
 * deliberately overrides the house array-destructure return convention.
 *
 * Mapping: upstream counts every source modification with a hidden
 * `flush: 'sync'` shadow watcher (`syncCounter`), accumulates the changes to
 * skip in `ignoreCounter`, and skips a trigger only when every counted change
 * came from `ignoreUpdates` (`ignoreCounter === syncCounter`, both counters
 * reset together). React offers no way to observe — let alone intercept — the
 * caller's `setSource`: changes only become visible at the next commit, where
 * automatic batching has already collapsed consecutive updates into a single
 * render. The port therefore approximates the counters with a one-shot
 * "ignore barrier": `ignoreUpdates(updater)` snapshots the latest observed
 * value, runs `updater` synchronously and arms the barrier; the next change
 * the watch observes is skipped (upstream skips it too when no other changes
 * follow) and the flag is consumed either way, so later genuine changes fire
 * again. `ignorePrevAsyncUpdates()` arms the same barrier for the changes
 * queued before the call (snapshot-style one-shot skip). A commit that
 * carries no source change disarms the barrier so a no-op updater cannot
 * consume a later genuine change.
 *
 * Divergences from upstream (React batching):
 * - Changes made inside `ignoreUpdates` and further changes made afterwards
 *   in the same synchronous batch collapse into one render, which the barrier
 *   skips as a whole — upstream would fire the trigger with the latest value.
 *   Let the updater's batch commit (return from the event handler) before
 *   making changes that must fire.
 * - If the updater produces no change and the very next commit carries a
 *   source change, that change is skipped where upstream would fire it (a
 *   commit without a source change disarms the barrier).
 * - The `flush` option is not ported — the callback fires in the effect after
 *   commit (upstream `flush: 'pre'` timing); where upstream's
 *   `flush: 'sync'` makes `ignorePrevAsyncUpdates` a no-op, here it always
 *   applies.
 * - `eventFilter` and the other `WatchWithFilterOptions` members (`deep`,
 *   pause/resume) are not ported.
 * - `stop()` keeps the effect registered but the callback becomes a no-op —
 *   observable behavior is identical (the callback never fires again).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const [source, setSource] = useState('foo')
 * const { ignoreUpdates } = useWatchIgnorable(source, v => console.log(`Changed to ${v}!`))
 * setSource('bar') // logs: Changed to bar!
 * ignoreUpdates(() => setSource('foobar')) // (nothing logged)
 * ```
