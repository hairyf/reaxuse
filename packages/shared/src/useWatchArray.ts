/**
 * React port of VueUse's `watchArray` — watch for an array with additions and removals.
 *
 * Mapping: built on the house `useWatch` — the list is a plain array value tracked across
 * renders, `useWatch` handles the change detection, and the previous list is diffed against
 * the next one with item-identity matching (like upstream) so the callback receives
 * `(newList, oldList, added, removed)`. The list is wrapped as a single-element watch
 * source (`[list]`) so `useWatch` tracks it by reference identity instead of spreading a
 * variable-length list into its dependency list (React requires a constant deps size).
 *
 * Divergences from the upstream Vue API:
 * - `source` is a plain array value — Vue's `WatchSource` forms (ref / getter / reactive)
 *   have no React equivalent, compute the array during render and pass it directly.
 * - The list is tracked by reference identity: replacing it with a new array fires the
 *   callback even when the items are identical (like a Vue ref reassignment), while
 *   re-renders that keep the same array reference do not fire.
 * - In-place mutations (`push` / `splice`) do not re-render — produce a new array
 *   (`setList([...list, item])`) to trigger the watch.
 * - The upstream `onCleanup` callback parameter is not ported — `useWatch` has no
 *   watch-cleanup equivalent, use `useEffect` cleanup in the component instead.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * useWatchArray(list, (newList, oldList, added, removed) => {
 *   console.log('added:', added, 'removed:', removed)
 * })
 * ```
