/**
 * Pausable watch — a watched value whose updates can be paused and resumed —
 * React port of VueUse's `watchPausable`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/shared watchPausable. Upstream wraps `watchWithFilter` with
 * `pausableFilter`: while paused the event filter drops invocations, and
 * `resume()` only re-activates the filter — changes made while paused are
 * never replayed, so the first change after resuming fires the callback with
 * the last committed value as `oldValue`. This port keeps those semantics on
 * house primitives: `useWatch` tracks the source across renders (Vue's
 * reactive dependency tracking becomes the effect dependency list, firing in
 * the effect after commit — upstream `flush: 'pre'` timing) and the callback
 * is skipped whenever the watcher is paused or stopped.
 *
 * The API follows the maintainer-directed watch-wrapper convention of issue
 * #263: the source is the caller's own state value (house `useWatch` source
 * convention) and the return is the upstream `WatchPausableReturn` object
 * shape.
 *
 * Divergences from upstream:
 * - `isActive` is a plain boolean state instead of a readonly ref — it updates
 *   across renders, and `pause()` / `resume()` made in the same batch as a
 *   source change are still honoured (the pause state is mirrored into a ref
 *   read by the effect).
 * - Changes made while paused are dropped — upstream `pausableFilter` defers
 *   nothing, so `resume()` does not replay them and never fires the callback
 *   by itself.
 * - The `deep`, `flush`, `eventFilter` and `eventFilterOptions` watch options
 *   are not ported — tracking is by `Object.is` identity, like a Vue ref
 *   reassignment.
 * - `stop()` keeps the effect registered but the callback becomes a no-op —
 *   observable behavior is identical (the callback never fires again), and
 *   `isActive` is unaffected, like upstream.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const [source, setSource] = useState('foo')
 * const { pause, resume } = useWatchPausable(source, v => console.log(`Changed to ${v}!`))
 * setSource('bar') // logs: Changed to bar!
 * pause()
 * setSource('foobar') // (nothing logged)
 * resume()
 * setSource('hello') // logs: Changed to hello!
 * ```
