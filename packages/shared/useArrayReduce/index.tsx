/**
 * Reactive `Array.reduce`
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/shared `useArrayReduce`
 * React port of VueUse's `useArrayReduce`.
 *
 * Mapping: upstream wraps `toValue(list).reduce(...)` in `computed(() => ...)`
 * and returns a `ComputedRef`; React has no reactive value tracking, so this
 * is a plain function recomputed on every render over the plain `list` array
 * the caller passes. Hold the array in `useState` and pass a new array to
 * observe a change — the reduced result recomputes on the next render.
 *
 * @see https://vueuse.org/shared/useArrayReduce/
 *
 * @example
 * const [list, setList] = useState([1, 2, 3])
 * useArrayReduce(list, (prev, item) => prev + item) // 6
 * setList([4, 2, 3]) // 9 on the next render
 *
 * @param list - the array was called upon.
 * @param reducer - a "reducer" function.
 *
 * @returns the value that results from running the "reducer" callback function to completion over the entire array.
