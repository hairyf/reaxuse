/**
 * Watch that can be triggered manually — extended watch that returns
 * `trigger()` to execute the callback immediately — React port of VueUse's
 * `watchTriggerable`.
 * Map from @vueuse/shared watchTriggerable.
 *
 * The API follows the maintainer-directed adjustment of issue #263: the
 * source is the caller's own state value (house `useWatch` source convention)
 * and the return is the upstream `WatchTriggerableReturn` object shape — this
 * deliberately overrides the house array-destructure return convention, and
 * the hook holds no observable state of its own (the internal render tick is
 * invisible to the caller).
 *
 * Mapping: upstream builds on `watchIgnorable`, which counts every source
 * modification with a hidden `flush: 'sync'` shadow watcher (`syncCounter`),
 * accumulates the changes to skip in `ignoreCounter`, and skips a trigger
 * only when every counted change came from `ignoreUpdates`
 * (`ignoreCounter === syncCounter`); `trigger()` calls the callback with the
 * current source value wrapped in `ignoreUpdates` so the manual invocation
 * does not disturb that accounting, and the previously registered `onCleanup`
 * side effect is cleaned up before every new invocation.
 *
 * React sees the caller's changes only at commit — there is no way to observe
 * (let alone intercept) `setSource`, and automatic batching has already
 * collapsed consecutive updates into a single render by then. The counters
 * are therefore approximated with a one-shot "ignore barrier":
 * `ignoreUpdates(updater)` snapshots the latest observed value, runs `updater`
 * synchronously and arms the barrier; the next change the watch observes is
 * skipped (upstream skips it too when no other changes follow) and the flag is
 * consumed either way, so later genuine changes fire again.
 * `ignorePrevAsyncUpdates()` arms the same barrier for the changes queued
 * before the call. The barrier is disarmed again when a commit carries no
 * source change (the updater produced nothing observable); an internal render
 * tick guarantees such a commit even when the updater is a no-op `setState`
 * that React would otherwise bail out of entirely — so a no-op updater can
 * never consume a later genuine change (upstream counts 0 changes and fires).
 *
 * `trigger()` fires synchronously at the call site — it does not wait for
 * React to commit and is unaffected by batching: it hands the current source
 * value straight to the callback with the old value `undefined` (upstream
 * cannot know it either; array sources get a per-element `undefined`) and
 * returns the callback's return value so async work can be awaited. Like
 * upstream, the invocation is wrapped in `ignoreUpdates`: a source change
 * queued by the callback inside `trigger()` is suppressed after its commit
 * (upstream counts it in `ignoreCounter`), and a callback that makes no
 * source change is disarmed by the forced commit, so a later genuine change
 * still fires.
 *
 * Divergences from upstream (React batching):
 * - Changes made inside `ignoreUpdates` and further changes made afterwards
 *   in the same synchronous batch collapse into one render, which the
 *   barrier skips as a whole — upstream would fire the callback with the
 *   latest value. Let the updater's batch commit before making changes that
 *   must fire.
 * - The `flush` option is not ported — the callback fires in the effect after
 *   commit (upstream `flush: 'pre'` timing); `eventFilter` and the other
 *   `WatchWithFilterOptions` members (`deep`, pause/resume) are not ported —
 *   only `immediate`.
 * - `stop()` keeps the effect registered but the callback becomes a no-op —
 *   observable behavior is identical (the callback never fires again).
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const [source, setSource] = useState('foo')
 * const { trigger, ignoreUpdates } = useWatchTriggerable(source, v => console.log(`Changed to ${v}!`))
 * setSource('bar') // logs: Changed to bar!
 * ignoreUpdates(() => setSource('foobar')) // (nothing logged)
 * trigger() // logs: Changed to foobar! — fired manually with the current value
 * ```
