import { useRef } from 'react'

/**
 * Return a value that is computed **once**, on the first render, and then
 * returned unchanged — same reference, same value — on every later render.
 *
 * reause-only addition — there is no upstream VueUse or react-use counterpart
 * to map from, so this hook mirrors no upstream API.
 *
 * Semantics:
 * - `initialValue` is resolved only on the **first** render. When it is a
 *   function it is **called exactly once** (lazily, during that first render)
 *   and its return value is kept; pass a function to defer an expensive
 *   initial computation until the component actually renders.
 * - Every subsequent render returns the very same value. For objects, arrays,
 *   or functions that means the **same identity** is preserved across renders,
 *   which is what `useState` or an inline computation would *not* give you —
 *   an inline `{}` / `compute()` runs on every render and produces a new value
 *   each time (re-triggering effects and memo comparisons that depend on it).
 * - The value is **not reactive**: changing `initialValue` after the first
 *   render has no effect, and mutating the returned value does not re-render
 *   the component. It is a constant for the lifetime of the component
 *   instance, which is exactly what makes it safe to use as a stable
 *   dependency in `useEffect` / `useMemo` / `useCallback` dependency arrays.
 * - Because the value lives in a ref, the hook is safe under concurrent
 *   rendering and server rendering: the first render (or the hydration render)
 *   computes it once.
 *
 * @example
 * // expensive computation runs once, not on every render
 * const config = useConst(() => buildExpensiveConfig())
 *
 * @example
 * // stable identity — the effect below runs once
 * const options = useConst({ immediate: true })
 * useEffect(() => connect(options), [options])
 *
 * @param initialValue The value to keep, or a factory returning it. The
 * factory is invoked once, on the first render.
