/**
 * Keep target state(s) in sync with a source value — React port of VueUse's
 * `syncRefs`.
 *
 * Map from @vueuse/shared `syncRefs`
 * (`source/vueuse/packages/shared/syncRefs/`), renamed `syncStates` for the
 * React port: the source is a `State<T>` — a plain value, getter, ref-like,
 * `[value, setter]` tuple or `{ value, onChange }` pair (upstream:
 * `WatchSource`) — resolved with `toValue`; the targets are writable
 * `State<T>` sources written back through their writable form (tuple setter /
 * `onChange` / `.current`); upstream's `flush` / `deep` / `immediate` options
 * are kept for signature compatibility.
 *
 * React Hook adaptation: upstream syncs through Vue's reactive `watch`, and
 * React has no reactive system — so `syncStates` is implemented as a hook
 * (call it unconditionally at the top of a component). Internally a
 * `useEffect` that runs after every commit compares the resolved source value
 * with the last observed one via `Object.is`; a change is written through to
 * all targets. Because the observation happens post-commit, the caller must
 * re-render (e.g. `setState`) for a new source value to reach the targets —
 * a bare mutation outside of React is never observed (see the maintainer
 * notes on reause #40 / #41). The returned `stop` function tears the
 * synchronization down; the effect also stops doing any work once the owning
 * component unmounts.
 *
 * @example
 * function Form() {
 *   const [source, setSource] = useState('hello')
 *   const [target, setTarget] = useState('target')
 *
 *   const stop = syncStates(source, [target, setTarget])
 *
 *   // during the first render `target` is still 'target' — the sync effect
 *   // runs after the commit, so the source reaches the target only once the
 *   // component has mounted (target === 'hello' afterwards).
 *   // Calling `setSource('foo')` re-renders and the effect then copies 'foo'
 *   // into the target state on the following commit.
 *
 *   stop()
 * }
