# useWatchImmediate

Shorthand for watching value with `{ immediate: true }`

## Usage

Similar to `useWatch`, but the callback also fires once on mount with the
current value.

```tsx
import { useWatchImmediate } from '@reause/shared'
import { useState } from 'react'

const [obj, setObj] = useState('vue-use')

// logs 'vue-use' on mount, then the new value on every change
useWatchImmediate(obj, (updated) => {
  console.log(updated)
})

// later, from an event handler:
setObj('VueUse') // logs 'VueUse'
```

`useWatchImmediate` takes no options — `immediate` is always `true`, and
upstream's `deep`/`flush`/`once` are not ported (tracking is by `Object.is`
identity and effects always run after commit). It returns `void`: upstream's
`WatchHandle.stop()` is not provided — watching ends when the component
unmounts.
